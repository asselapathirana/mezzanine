Notes:

1. Do not use mezzanine as directory, project or application name. This will conflict with mezzanine python package if done. 
2. the project_name variable (pass.yml) should be same as application_name (fixed in pass.yml, but keep as it is)
3. ./manage.py createsuperuser  need to be run manually before logging into admin interface
